        <br><br><p>An initial note: I asked AI to draft this for me. It makes me look much more sophisticated than I am. 
        From one human being to another: I don't want to invade your privacy. Ignoring the fact that I will never open this service
        to anyone but myself, I could not be less interested in the lives of users. I don't make any money off of this, and frankly
        have better things to do than mine data from texts of random strangers. That said - here is some legalese promising the same.</p>
        <br><p><strong style = "font-size: 25px;">Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <br><strong>Effective Date: November 16, 2025</strong>
        <div style = "text-align: left;"><br><p>This Privacy Policy explains how Cosmo The Budget Bot ("Cosmo," "we," "us," or "our") manages the information collected 
        from users ("User" or "you") of our SMS-based budget tracking service. Our mission is to provide a highly private budgeting tool; 
        therefore, we prioritize minimalism and security in our data collection practices.</p>
        <br>1. Data Collection and Usage
        <br>We collect and use only the minimal data necessary to operate and improve the Cosmo service.
        <br><br>A. Information You Provide Directly
        <br>When you interact with Cosmo via SMS, you provide the following data:
        <ul>
            <li>Phone Number: Your mobile number is collected to send and receive messages necessary for the budget service. 
                This is the primary identifier.</li>
            <li>Budgetary Data: The amounts you text us (e.g., initial budget, expense amounts, expense categories) are collected 
                and stored to perform the running tally calculation.</li>
            <li>Support/Inquiry Data: If you contact us via the support email, your name (if provided) and email address are collected 
                to respond to your inquiry.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>B. Use of Data
        <br>Your data is used strictly for the following purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>Service Operation: To send you automated responses, confirmation of expenses, and your remaining budget tally.</li>
            <li>Service Improvement: To analyze usage patterns and improve the bot’s responsiveness and functionality.</li>
            <li>Security and Compliance: To comply with legal requirements and prevent fraud or misuse of the service.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>2. Non-Collection and Non-Disclosure
        <br>Cosmo's core value is privacy. We emphasize the following non-collection and non-disclosure practices:
        <ul>
            <li>No Financial Account Information: We do not collect, store, or have access to your bank account details, credit card numbers, 
                or other sensitive financial credentials. The budget tracking is based solely on numbers you manually input.</li>
            <li>No Sharing for Marketing: We do not sell, rent, or share your phone number, budgetary data, or personal information 
                with any third parties for marketing, advertising, or promotional purposes.</li>
            <li>No Location Tracking: We do not track your geographic location via your mobile device.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>3. Data Retention and Security
        <br>We employ reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information.
        <ul>
            <li>Retention: We retain your phone number and budgetary data for as long as you are actively using the service. If you reply STOP, 
                your active enrollment is terminated, and your data may be securely archived or deleted in accordance with our data retention schedule.</li>
            <li>Deactivation (Opt-Out): Replying STOP immediately removes you from the active messaging program.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>4. Changes to This Policy
        <br>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. 
        Your continued use of the service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</div>
